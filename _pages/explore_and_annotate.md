Excel spreadsheets can be explored and annotated without the need to download.

Individual or groups of cells can be annotated with text. Time series data can be annotated and stored as a plot.
Along with the annotations, contents of the spreadsheets are also indexed and searchable - so data can be discovered by searching within their content.
