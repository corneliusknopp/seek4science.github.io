There are two different ways for you to start using SEEK:

Our [User Guide](https://docs.seek4science.org/help/user-guide/index.html) gives you information on getting started.
* You can download and install a **local deployment** of SEEK for your project/group, or deploy using **Docker**: please visit [https://docs.seek4science.org/get-seek.html](https://docs.seek4science.org/get-seek.html)
